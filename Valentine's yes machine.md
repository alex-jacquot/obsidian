Screen 0: "Will you be my Valentine? :LiHeart:  "
Screen 1 : "OOps you misclicked, try clicking Yes again." Nothing else changes.
Screen 2: "Haha very funny, click yes please" Make the green button a bit bigger
Screen 3: Make the green button even bigger and the red button slightly less big.
Screen 4: Make the Green Button take the entirety of the screen and a tiny red No button on the bottom right corner.
Screen 5: Put Yes in the exact middle of the screen and give it the drag property, with the obvious hand drag cursor on hover. Put the No button under this yes button, you have to drag the yes button away to click the Nope button.

Screen 6: "Alright then, you can rack your brain solving this math problem or you can just ,you know, press Yes.." "Put the Yes button, and below it a math problem: "(26+6-8)*2" with an input box next to it, if the text box has the correct answer, it counts as if the No is clicked.

Screen 7:  "Guess what? I removed the No button. Good luck trying not pressing Yes." There is a Yes button but no No Button. The No from the text looks like the rest of text and actually glows red when hovering it. When pressed, it counts as clicking the No button.

Screen 8: "Would you like not to be my Valentine?", Yes and No button are normal but clicking Yes means No and Vice Versa.

Screen 9: "Guess what movie it is", have a picture of the Yes man movie and a text box to fill with ____ Man. Typing Yes means clicking Yes, Typing no means clicking No. 

Screen 10: A bunch of small yes buttons covering up the entirety of the screen in all sizes shapes and angles, with 1 little red button being lost in it all.

Screen 11: A modal appears with some funny text about terms and conditions with a few funny paragraphs about our date, scrolling down to the endo f paragraph reveals 2 buttons "Agree", "Not Disagree" both counteing as Yes when Clicked. There's a classic close icon button at the top right which when pressed, counts as a no.

Scene 12: Let's draw a trolley problem on that one. Let's assume we use an empty trolley image problem as the background then put the Yes and No respectively on the end of each track (the yes being on the straight track). Where the lever is is a button we can press to swi taking the path according if the lever is pressed. If the lever is pressed after arriving to the inttch the path. We also have an animated trolley arriving at the intersection after 5 seconds and thenersection, then 2 seconds after, the no will be "clicked", otherwise ti'll be the yes.  The text reads "This is a trolley problem, the trolley is on the right track and will arrive safely to our date. Please set back and relax. We don't want it to crash."

Scene 13: Let's have a big scrolling text like the Star Wars Opening styles. There are 2 paragraphs detailing how the world is at an end and we're the last 2 people on earth with the task of repopulatin earth. Below the 2 paragraphs will appear a big column of 4 consecutive yes buttons, then a small no button, then 4 more yes buttons? THen stop. All buttons are functional.

Scene 14: 2 normally positioned Yes and No button. However when approaching the cursor close to the no button, the button will smoothyl go to the direction opposite to the cursor as if trying to escape, in a way that the only way to escape it is to trap the button in a corner.

Scene 15: This one will be tough, we have a blank canvas in the middle of the screen

Scene 16: Normal buttons. Would you be against the hypothetical idea of not refusing the idea of not going on a date with me?
