Plays with cards and the d20

Cards allow you to roll for an action, based on your stats

Steal, attack, hide, evade.

Any cards to flavor it, lots of starter cards (1 for each class)

Use action, bonus action and reaction. Spells slots. Concentration. Board field?

Monsters to fight for loot, amount and rarity varies. 

At the beginning it’s worth attacking more monsters than players.
