# **Pearlissimo (Working Title)**

A card game of bluff, chaos, and ambition.

---

## **Goal of the Game**

Players compete to be the first to reach **15 Victory Points (VPs)**.

- Victory Points are gained by redeeming **Victory Cards**, which require specific conditions or resources.
- Along the way, players accumulate **Stars** (currency), manipulate **Cards**, and navigate **Bluffs and Challenges** to rise as either the **CEO** or the **Mastermind**.

---

## The Six Clans of the Monster Market

Each Pearlissimo card belongs to one of six monster clans, each tied to a color and a philosophy of power.

### 🔴 Goblins — *Saboteurs of Fortune*

The Goblin cartels thrive in the shadows of the marketplace. They manipulate, sabotage, and steal whatever isn’t nailed down. Goblins believe chaos is the quickest route to pearls.

- Specialties: Sabotage, stealing Stars, bluff-heavy tricks.
- Relies heavily on Illegal cards, acquiring Criminal stacks and/or being the Mastermind

### 🟡 Dwarves — *Bankers of the Deep Vaults*

Dwarves run the monster banks, their vaults overflowing with gold and secrets. They hand out loans, forge ledgers, and know that every Pearl has a price.

- Specialties: Banking, resource hoarding, raw Stars.

### 🔵 Elves — *Bureaucrats of the Enchanted Offices*

Elves sit behind endless desks of contracts and laws, weaving the rules of the marketplace to their benefit. Their bureaucracy strangles opponents, but their systems reward loyalty.

- Specialties: Permanent effects, global rules, control.

### 🟢 Orcs — *Enforcers and Tycoons*

Orcs run factories, shipping, and protection rackets. They value honor and strength, rising through business stacks to dominate like moguls.

- Specialties: Business stacks, CEO bonuses, “fair” but costly ventures.

### ⚪ Vampires — *Aristocrats of Secrets*

Vampires sip information like fine wine. They control the shadows of deals, revealing just enough truth to tip the balance. Every pearl they own carries the scent of manipulation.

- Specialties: Information, card draw, forcing reveals.

### 🌈 Dragons — *Legends of Hoard and Fire*

Dragons are rare, powerful, and devastating. When they appear, they warp the whole market, hoarding pearls and leaving ashes in their wake.

- Specialties: Expensive, powerful global effects, ultimate rewards.

## **Components**

- **Regular Cards**:
    - Each card has a **color value**: Red, Yellow, Blue, Green, White, or Rainbow.
    - Each card has a **cost** (in colors, Stars, or stacks), and an **effect** (one-use, permanent, or disruptive).
    - A card can be used for either its **effect** or for its **color value** (to pay other cards’ costs or trade at the Bank).
- **Victory Cards**:
    - Special cards providing Victory Points and sometimes other rewards that are always redeemable
- **Stars**: The game’s currency. Earned through trades, card effects, or salaries.
- **Stacks**:
    - **Business Stacks (BM)**: Earned by winning challenges.
    - **Criminal Stacks (CR)**: Earned by losing challenges.

---

## **Setup**

1. Each player draws randomly **3 cards in hand**.
2. Reveal **3 active Victory Cards** from the Victory deck and place them face up.
3. Reveal 5** face-up Regular Cards** from the draw pile into the open pile.
4. Place the rest of the deck as the **draw pile**.
5. Discard pile starts empty.

Play proceeds **clockwise**. The first player is the one in the group that made the most idiotic thing in their lives (or whoever ended last in last game).

---

## **Player Turn**

On your turn, you must perform **1 action**, then end your turn.

### Available Actions:

6. **Draw Cards**
    - Take 2 cards from any mix of the draw pile or the 3 visible face-up cards.
    - Immediately refill any face-up cards taken.
    - You may never exceed **7 cards in hand**, unless stated otherwise. If drawing would exceed 7, the draw is illegal, or is limited to 1 card in case of 6 hands.
    - Before drawing, you may spend 2 stars to reroll the cards present, by putting them in the discard pile and drawing 5 new cards.
7. **Buy a Card**
    - Pay its cost (colors, Stars, fulfill its requirements).
    - One-use cards resolve immediately.
    - Permanent cards remain face-up in front of you.
    - *Disruptive cards may be played in specific situations, generally outside your turn.*
8. **Exchange with the Bank**
    - Trade sets of cards for Stars (see Exchange Rules).
9. **Redeem a Victory Card**
    - Pay the requirement of one of the 3 active Victory Cards to claim its rewards. Refresh with a new Victory card.
10. **Discard Cards**
    - Discard any number of cards from your hand to the discard pile.

---

## **Exchange with the Bank**

You may discard card sets to gain Stars.

There are 2 versions of exchanges corresponding to the 2 sides of the Bank card. We recommend using the **Regular** side for the first few games, then switch to the **Advanced **side once everyone is familiar.

- 2 of the same color → +1 Star (no bluff)
- 3 of the same color → +2 Stars (no bluff)
- 4 of the same color → +3 Stars and 1 BM(may bluff 1 card)
- 5 of the same color → +4 Stars and 2 BM(may bluff up to 2 cards)
- 1 of each color → +4 Stars and 2 BM(may bluff up to 2 cards)
- 3 Rainbows → +5 Stars (no bluff)
- X star → Remove X Criminal Stack
- Get 1 BM Stack → 2 stars

---

## **Bluff and Challenge**

### Bluffing Opportunities

- **At the Bank**: In trades that allow bluffing (4 of same, 5 of same, 1 of each), you may hide 1–2 cards.
- **Buying Certain Cards**: Some cards allow bluff counts, letting you hide part of the payment.

### Challenging Rules

- Any opponent may challenge a hidden card.
- If only 1 card is hidden, only 1 challenge is possible.
- If 2 cards are hidden, a second player may challenge the other after the first is resolved.
- The challenger chooses which hidden card to reveal.

### Challenge Outcomes

- **If the hidden card matches the declared cost** → The challenger loses. They must give up 1 card or 1 Star. The bluff succeeds.
- **If the hidden card does not match** → The bluff fails. The action is cancelled and the turn is skipped. The bluffer must give up 1 card or 1 Star.

### Stacks from Challenges

- **Winning a challenge**: +1 Business Stack.
- **Losing a challenge**: +1 Criminal Stack.

---

## **Business and Criminal Stacks**

- Stacks are permanent unless removed by specific cards.
- Many cards require BM or CR stacks as costs or provide bonuses based on them.

### CEO and Mastermind Roles

- At any time, the player with **most Business stacks** becomes the **CEO** (no ties).
- At any time, the player with **most Criminal stacks** becomes the **Mastermind** (no ties).

**CEO Benefits:**

- You may draw an additionnal card from the open pile.

**CEO Downside:**

**Mastermind Benefits:**

- At the start of your turn, gain +1 Star(salary)
- Idiot/chaos-themed cards may become cheaper or stronger in your hands.

**Mastermind Downside:**

- Cannot initiate challenges (no credibility).
- Redeeming a Victory Card always costs +1 extra Star.

---

## **Deck & Discards**

- All used, paid, or exchanged cards go to the discard pile.
- If the draw pile empties, reshuffle the discard pile to form a new draw pile.

---

## **Redeeming Victory Cards**

- As a turn action, you may pay the requirement of one active Victory Card to redeem it.
- Rewards are **Victory Points**, sometimes with Stars or bonuses.
- Keep redeemed Victory Cards visible in front of you.
- The first player to reach **15 Victory Points** wins immediately.
