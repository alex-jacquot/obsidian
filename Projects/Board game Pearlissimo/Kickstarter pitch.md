# PEARLISSIMO – PITCH STRATEGY PLAYBOOK

## 1. Core Positioning (what Pearlissimo *is*)

### One-sentence hook

> Pearlissimo is a strategic bluffing card game where monster corporations and crime syndicates compete to control magical pearls through deals, deception, and ruthless efficiency.

This sentence must always appear in:

- Publisher email
- Kickstarter header
- Sell sheet
- Video opening

---

## 2. Genre & Market Fit

### Category

- Strategic card game
- Bluffing & hidden information
- Medium weight
- Competitive, high interaction

### Comparable Games (important for publishers)

Use **2–3 max**, never more:

- *Gremlins Inc.* (political chaos & reputation systems)
- *Coup* (bluffing and calling bluffs)
- *Splendor* (engine building with clean UX)

Phrase it like this:

> “Pearlissimo combines the bluff tension of Coup, the reputational chaos of Gremlins Inc., and the clean economic clarity of Splendor.”

---

## 3. Target Audience

### Players

- 14+
- 2–5 players
- 45–75 minutes
- Strategy gamers who enjoy interaction, negotiation, and risk

### Why this matters

Publishers want:

- Clear audience
- Not “everyone”
- Not too niche

---

## 4. What Makes Pearlissimo Special (USPs)

This is the **heart of the pitch**.

### Unique Selling Points

### 1. Dual Reputation System

- **Business stacks vs Criminal stacks**
- Both are powerful
- Both have consequences
- Players weaponize reputation

> “You are rewarded for winning and losing challenges in different ways.”

### 2. Bluff Is a Resource, Not Just a Risk

- Bluff counts are *mechanical*
- Cards, banks, and victory conditions use bluff explicitly

This is rare and very pitchable.

### 3. Victory Cards Are Dynamic Objectives

- Not fixed end goals
- Rotate, disappear, reappear
- Encourage adaptive play

### 4. Color-Driven Playstyles

- Each color is a philosophy
- Players naturally lean into archetypes
- No forced roles

### 5. High Interaction, Low Downtime

- Reactions
- Challenges
- Visible incentives to interact

Publishers love this.

---

## 5. Visual Identity Pitch

This reassures editors and backers.

### Art Direction

- Clean parchment style
- Warm browns, restrained fantasy
- Readable at a glance
- Strong iconography

### Theme Framing

> “Monster capitalism. Ancient magic treated like stock options.”

Tone:

- Satirical
- Smart
- Slightly dark
- Never goofy

---

## 6. Pitching to a Publisher (Asmodee-style)

### What they want

- Proven core loop
- Replayability
- Clear differentiation
- Production feasibility

### What to prepare

### A. Sell Sheet (1 page)

Must include:

- Title + hook
- Player count / time
- 3 bullet USPs
- One clean image
- Your contact

### B. Rules PDF (clean)

- 10–12 pages max
- No flavor walls
- Examples over edge cases

### C. Prototype

- Physical or Tabletop Simulator
- Clean, legible, not fancy

### Email Structure

1. Short intro
2. Why Pearlissimo fits *their* catalog
3. One-sentence hook
4. Sell sheet link
5. Ask for feedback, not commitment

---

## 7. Pitching on Kickstarter / Gamefound

This is a **different mindset**.

### Kickstarter Hook (Top of Page)

> “In Pearlissimo, monsters don’t fight wars. They run businesses.”

Then immediately:

- What players do
- Why it’s tense
- Why it’s fun

---

## 8. Kickstarter Page Structure

### Section Order

6. Big art + hook
7. What is Pearlissimo
8. How to win
9. How bluff works
10. Criminal vs Business stacks
11. Victory cards
12. Components
13. Player count / time
14. Stretch goals
15. Timeline
16. Who you are

### Important Rule

Never explain everything.

Tease complexity.

Show depth visually.

---

## 9. Kickstarter Video Strategy

### Length

- 90–120 seconds

### Structure

17. Theme hook (10s)
18. Table view (20s)
19. Bluff & challenge moment (30s)
20. Reputation twist (20s)
21. Victory condition tease (10s)
22. Call to action (10s)

No rules dump.

No long explanations.

---

## 10. Stretch Goal Philosophy

Do **not** add mechanics.

Good stretch goals:

- New Victory cards
- Alternate player cards
- Cosmetic upgrades
- Extra gray meta cards

Bad stretch goals:

- New systems
- New currencies
- Anything that increases teaching time

---

## 11. Community Building Before Launch

### 3–6 months before

- Post design diaries
- Polls about card names
- Tease art

### 1 month before

- Rules preview
- Print-and-play
- Influencer previews

---

## 12. Final Confidence Line

Use this when pitching verbally:

> “Pearlissimo creates stories where winning a challenge can be as dangerous as losing one, and power always comes with consequences.”

That sentence alone sells the game.
