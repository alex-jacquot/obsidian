Dressed like a barbie

Saxophone addict

American

Throws her ring away

Macarena dancer

Charms french boys

Kindling spirit to parties of juicy raclettes
Excels in music, with her sax-y tunes of peace,
Nurtured in the art of drunk-dancing and pirouettes
Now and then a blonde Barbie, her charms do tease,
And a welcome sight she is, for a new year’s Eve
