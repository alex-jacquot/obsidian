A bit of teesting

Hello    hiring team,

I saw your job offer and I believe your company and me would be a good technical and human match.

I have strong experience in JS/TS, notably with Next.JS based stack in both front-end and back-end, and recently React Native with Expo. I have also a bit of experience with infra with both GCP and Azure.

I have both experience in entrepreneurship and corporate, as I co-founded 2 tech startups, [Celect.ai](http://celect.ai/) (AI tools for recruiting) and Tokenomeme (Web3 and social network) , and worked for both consulting at Accenture and developer software for micro-satellites at CS Engineering.

I’m used to lead broad and educated technical decisions for production-grade applications and code hands-on on all the projects I’ve been in. I also am used to learn new technologies by myself.

If you need someone with a broad technological overview and is a fast-learner then let’s talk! Feel free to contact me through mail or phone. I’m also based in Prague for a quick face-to-face interview.

Best regards,

Alex.
