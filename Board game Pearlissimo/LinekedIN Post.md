IAfter 2+ months of work, I crafted from scratch a complete new board game as a side hobby.

  

I present to you: PEARLISSIMO! 🥳

  

150+ unique cards with custom artwork, its own simple playing board. I also coded a complete multi-purpose card editor just to save some time when making and testing different cards.

  

For the board game aficionado out here, it's a fast-paced strategy game, fairly easy to get into but hard to master, with a bunch of ways to bluff, steal or jail people, but also to build a somewhat improvised economy, hoard resources and find the perfect "feel-good" card combos. 🃏

  

Now that I'm (FINALLY) done with the design and printing part, I'm currently enjoying the playtesting with friends part 😁.

  

Once that's done, the plan would be to launch a kickstarter to add a professionnal touch to the few design flaws and finally get my game printed by a publisher! (Perhaps [asmodee](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#), a man can dream)

  

More videos to come as the game gets the last refining touches and get some popularity!
