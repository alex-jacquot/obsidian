- Global Cross-adventure plot: The Silencer
    
    ## 🌌 **The Antagonist: The Nameless Null (a.k.a. "The Silencer")**
    
    ### **Nature**:
    
    - A **multiplanar, anti-existence entity** — not of void, but of _unbeing_.
    - It has no true name in the tongues of gods or mortals — only whispered titles: **The Silencer**, **The Null-Scribe**, **That Which Unwrites**.
    
    ### **Goal**:
    
    - **Poison the Weave** by infecting its core logic, unraveling spells from within.
    - **Imprison or "nullify" gods of magic and prophecy**, removing their influence from reality.
    - Replace divine purpose with **narrative entropy** — weakening faith, severing divine influence.
    
    ### **Signs of its influence**:
    
    - _Spells that flicker or “recast” strangely._
    - _Dreams filled with backward echoes or silences where names should be._
    - _Artifacts that decay into sand when activated._
    - _Temples where the gods do not answer — or answer wrong._
    
    ### **Minions & Tools**:
    
    - **Nullborn**: Creatures that bleed static or silence — sometimes ex-clerics, warlocks, or aberrations.
    - **Fragmented Texts**: Broken prophecies, shattered scrolls that omit vital words.
    - **Dead Magic Zones** growing like infection spots on the world.

    ## 🧙‍♂️ **The Recruiter: Azuth, The High One**
    
    ### **Why Azuth?**
    
    - Former mortal wizard → god of **arcane knowledge and magical order**.
    - Once **Mystra’s Chosen**, now her divine steward and **guardian of the laws of magic**.
    - Seeks to preserve balance not just in spellcasting, but in _magic as a cosmic language_.
    
    ### **His Role in the Plot**:
    
    - **Covertly watches over the party**, using visions, coincidences, and warding glyphs.
    - Provides access to **ancient magical lore** or sealed vaults others cannot open.
    - May **bless the party’s items, shield their minds, or send celestial dreams**.
    - Cannot act directly, lest he draw the Silencer’s gaze — _but works subtly_.
    
    ---
    
    ## ✨ Relevant Pantheon Ties (Faerûnian Structure)
    
    ### 🕸️ **Mystra (Weakened)**
    
    - Goddess of the Weave, divine magic.
    - Her weakening explains **spell instability**, rogue arcane effects, and why divine prayers go unanswered.
    
    ### 🧿 **Savras** – God of Divination
    
    - Imprisoned early by the Silencer.
    - Prophets and oracles now **speak nonsense or repeat broken time loops**.
    
    ### 🔥 **Azuth** – God of Wizards
    
    - Protective mentor figure. Trying to **build a network of capable mortals** — not just mages.
    
    ### ⚖️ **Oghma** – God of Knowledge
    
    - Might be assisting Azuth in secret, hiding forbidden lore.
    - Could be the keeper of a sealed vault of truth _about the Silencer_.
    
    ### ❌ **Shar** – Goddess of Loss and Darkness
    
    - Might be attempting to **ally with the Silencer**, or secretly manipulated by it.
    
    ### 🌀 **Selûne** – Goddess of Moon and Mysticism
    
    - Her moonlight is one of the few divine sources that **"reveals what is erased."**
    
    ---
    
    ## 🎮 Plot Thread Suggestions
    
    - Each arc, the party **recovers lost relics, forgotten truths, or uncovers damaged divine domains**.
    - NPCs they encounter (clerics, wizards, bards) may show **signs of having their memory or magic warped**.
    - **Every major dungeon or vault contains a “null scar”** — some sign of what’s been erased from reality.
    - Azuth may eventually reveal himself only when the party is **ready to challenge a major Nullborn lieutenant**.

    ## 🧙‍♂️ **DM Introduction Box Text – Arriving in Dawnmere**
    
    > The road curves gently down from the hills, revealing a quiet, sun-dappled town nestled in a shallow valley. Dawnmere rises between wheat fields and glinting patches of forest, its cobbled streets weaving past timber-framed homes and stone chimneys that puff lazy curls of smoke.
    > 
    > At its heart lies a lively town square — lined with merchant stalls, the clang of a blacksmith’s forge, and the scent of baked bread and fresh herbs. Banners of faded blue and gold flutter from rooftops, bearing a simple crest: a rising sun over a silver field.
    > 
    > Beyond the bustle, your eyes are drawn to three landmarks: a tall, shrine-shaped **temple**, a shop with a cracked arcane sign swaying in the breeze, and the silhouette of a **guard tower** marking the town’s southern entrance.
    > 
    > This is **Dawnmere**, a place where forgotten gods linger, and where your fates are beginning to intertwine.

- 📍Town Place: Wandering Spark
    
    - Initial Description Inside
        
        As you push open the creaking door, a rush of still, stale air greets you — thick with the scent of burnt parchment, melted wax, and faintly charred wood. The room is dim, illuminated only by a few guttering arcane lanterns that flicker with unstable light.
        
        Shelves have been overturned or splintered. Scrolls lie shredded across the floor like fallen feathers. A glass display case near the counter is shattered — its velvet-lined interior empty but for a few strands of glimmering thread.
        
        The counter stands off to one side, scratched and partially scorched, as if something exploded behind it. Strange black marks spiral up the wall behind it — too precise to be burn patterns, too jagged to be arcane runes…
        
        Near the far wall, bathed in a narrow shaft of sunlight cutting through a crack in the ceiling, stands a **weathered statue of a robed figure** — arms extended, palms cupped, holding a smooth orb of stone that faintly glows golden. Dust drifts lazily in the beam of light, giving the figure a strangely reverent glow.
        
        “You notice the mimic head mounted behind the counter — its wooden tongue slightly ajar, almost as if it’s waiting for someone to ask the right question… or feed it a good story.”
        
        Faint scuff marks and deep gouges in the floor hint at a **recent struggle** — but curiously, no bodies. No blood. Just silence… and a growing sense that something here still listens.
        
    - Exterior Located a short walk from Dawnmere’s town center, the shop appears old, its front **sign crooked**, swinging slightly in the breeze. It shows a sunburst with a spark running through it

    - Interior
        
        ## 🧭 **Interior Layout – Ground Floor**
        
        ### 🪟 General Atmosphere:
        
        - Shelves overturned, scrolls half-burnt, books scattered.
        - Broken glass litters the floor, and magical items clearly **stolen or corrupted**.
        - The room has **dim golden lighting**, pulsing softly — a ward still functioning somewhere.
        
        ---
        
        ### 🗡️ **Behind the Counter**
        
        - The wooden counter is chipped and overturned.
        - Journal of Thamior: “All the latest magic items are broken, not old age” “ Collector came”
        - Hidden beneath the counter is a **Bag of Almost Holding** – similar to a Bag of Holding, but after containing 7–8 items, one is ejected randomly, occasionally **animated** for 1 minute (DM discretion).
        - There’s also:
            - Burned order slips
            - A **half-burned map fragment** of a secret place beneath Dawnmere
            - A symbol of **Amaunator scratched over with another glyph** (Hourglass Veil symbol)
        
        ---
        
        ### ⚠️ **Trap: Psychic Marking Rune**
        
        On a shelf near the back wall sits a cracked **mirror**. Hidden beneath it:
        
        - A **Glyph of Warding (Psychic variant)**, disguised as a faint hourglass symbol.
        - When triggered (by disturbing the mirror or stepping too close without detection):
            - **DC 13 INT save**, or take **2d6 psychic damage** and become **marked with a glowing glyph** visible only to cultists or under _Detect Magic_.
        
        ---
        
        ## 🛡️ **Magical Arcane Door – Upstairs Blocked**
        
        A glowing **sigil-sealed archway** blocks access to the second floor staircase.
        
        - Inscribed in celestial script:
        
        > "Only light in truth shall pass upward."
        
        - **Cannot be dispelled** or bypassed with brute force. Only unlocks if the speaker says the phrase:
        
        > "Order is the fire that tempers chaos."
        
        - (A phrase known only to **Thamior**, or found in divine texts from the Temple’s Amaunator shrine.)
        
        Attempting to force it open deals **1d6 force damage** and repels the creature 10 feet.
        
        ---
        
        ## 🌞 **Statue of Amaunator (Puzzle & Basement Access)**
        
        Near the east wall, half-shadowed by broken ceiling beams, stands a **tall, cracked statue of Amaunator**. He holds a **sunstone** in his hands, and a **ray of sunlight** filters from above, landing faintly on the **statue's chest**.
        
        > On the base of the statue, a weathered inscription reads: “Truth under the sun reveals the path to what’s below.”
        
        ---
        
        ### 🔍 **Puzzle Mechanism**
        
        There’s a **hidden compartment** under the statue’s feet, revealed only when:
        
        - The statue is bathed in **direct sunlight** (real or simulated).
        - Alternatively: a **mirror** can be used to reflect sunlight to the chest.
        
        When activated:
        
        - A faint click sounds.
        - A **portion of the floor shifts**, revealing a **trapdoor** beneath the statue leading to the **basement**.
        
        ---
        
        ## 🧩 **Optional Clues & Interactions**
        
        - **Casting _Light_ or _Guidance_ while praying** at the statue may grant a **whispered phrase**: “He kept the truth buried in light and silence.”
        - **Arcana DC 13** or **Religion DC 14** allows players to deduce Amaunator’s rituals often include **sunlight-based riddles**.
        - If the players cast _Detect Magic_, the floor around the statue glows with **evocation and divination magic** — hinting at a hidden mechanism.
        
        ---
        
        ## 🪙 Optional Hidden Treasure (Advanced Search DC 17)
        
        Behind a false stone panel in a toppled bookshelf lies a **lead-lined chest** containing:
        
        - A **Scroll of Radiant Ward** (custom spell protecting from necrotic damage)
        - **Gold-etched monocle of Truthsight** (acts like _Detect Magic_ once/day)
        - **Notes on Hourglass Veil operations**, listing village targets (including **Thamior**, **Meran**, and **Auryn**)
    - Basement

            “When the sun stands highest, shadow hides the least. Let thy truth be spoken beneath its gaze, and in return, the light shall speak its own.”
            
            "The light of the sun falls twice: once in truth, once in shadow. Where the light was sparked and truth concealed, a relic waits in slumber.” A successful **Religion (DC 13)** or **Investigation (DC 15)** check lets the party associate the phrase “light was sparked” with the name of the shop.

                **Camouflaged Hide.** The Grick has advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made to hide in rocky or dimly lit environments.
                
                **Moonlight Cloak.** While in dim light or darkness, the Grick can use a bonus action to become invisible until the start of its next turn. Recharge 5–6.
                
                **Radiant Fang (1/Day).** Once per day, the Grick can empower a tentacle attack with lunar energy. The attack deals an additional **1d6 radiant damage**, and the target must succeed on a **DC 12 Constitution saving throw** or be blinded until the end of its next turn.

    ---
    
    ### 🌘 Traits
    
    ### 🌓 **Fractured Form (Multi-Initiative)**
    
    The Lunashroud acts on **two separate initiative counts** (e.g. +2 and +7). It cannot take reactions and may not repeat the same action type on both turns (no double Multiattack, etc.).
    
    ---
    
    ### 🌿 **Divine Root Regeneration**
    
    While the **Lunarcrescent** scimitar remains bound in vines, the Lunashroud may use a **bonus action** on either turn to **regain 1d8+2 HP**.
    
    - When the weapon is removed or severed from the vines, the Lunashroud takes **2d6 radiant damage** and **loses this trait** permanently.
    
    ---
    
    ### 🌒 **Moon-Maddened Aura** _(Initiative 20)_
    
    At the start of each round (initiative 20), the Lunashroud emits a pulse of lunar energy.
    
    - All creatures within 10 feet must succeed on a **DC 12 Wisdom save** or be **disoriented** (disadvantage on next attack or save).
    
    ---
    
    ### ⚔️ Actions
    
    ### 🌑 **Lashing Tendril**
    
    _Melee Weapon Attack_: +4 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target
    
    Hit: **2d6 + 2 necrotic damage**
    
    - On hit, target must succeed on a **DC 11 Strength save** or be **pulled 5 feet** and knocked **prone**.
    
    ---
    
    ### 🌘 **Lunar Shriek (Recharge 5–6)**
    
    The Lunashroud emits a guttural, echoing cry.
    
    - Each creature within 15 ft. must make a **DC 12 Constitution saving throw**.
    - On a fail, take **1d8 psychic damage** and be **unable to speak or cast spells with verbal components** until the end of their next turn.
    - On a success, take half damage.
    
    ---
    
    ### 🪙 Loot
    
    - **Lunarcrescent**, the silver-blessed scimitar of Selûne (can be restored by priesthood or identified with _Detect Magic_).
    - Faint magical aura may lead to visions of Selûne or hint at **Nullborn corruption** beneath the Weave.
    
    ## 🌙 **Redemption Mechanic: Breaking the Curse of the Lunashroud**
    
    This system allows players to **weaken or even restore** Meran’s mind during the fight, combining **divine action, roleplay, and creative thinking**.
    
    ---
    
    ### 🧠 Step 1: Realizing It’s Still Him
    
    During the fight, you can drop subtle cues that the Lunashroud is not mindless:
    
    - It repeats **phrases from Selûne's prayers**, often broken or backwards.
    - It may pause briefly near **a symbol of Selûne** or during radiant effects.
    - Its central eye sheds **a single glowing tear** if a player uses _Sanctuary_, _Protection from Evil_, or a prayer.
    
    **Insight DC 13** can reveal “some part of him is still fighting inside.”
    
    ---
    
    ### ✨ Step 2: Breaking Through the Madness
    
    Once per round (or up to 3 times during combat), a character can attempt to **call to Meran** or attempt to restore his sanity instead of attacking.
    
    They may use:
    
    ### 🎭 Roleplay-Based
    
    - **Persuasion, Religion, or Performance** checks (DC 14)
    - Must be paired with **meaningful words or memories**: “You gave me food when I was wounded,” “Selûne is not silence, she is mercy.”
    
    ### 🔮 Magic-Based
    
    - _Sanctuary_, _Protection from Evil and Good_, _Calm Emotions_, _Bless_, or even a **Channel Divinity** from a good-aligned cleric can give **advantage** to redemption attempts.
    
    ### 🗡️ Symbolic Actions
    
    - Touching the **Lunarcrescent** weapon and using it **non-lethally**.
    - Casting **Light** or **Moonbeam** on the vines surrounding the weapon or the abomination.
    - Reciting Selûne’s **tenets** (researchable at the temple).
    
    ---
    
    ### 🌕 Step 3: Redemption Outcome
    
    If players **succeed 3 total redemption checks** (or land a critical narrative/magical moment), the following happens:
    
    - Meran **collapses mid-fight**, the Lunashroud form melting into a silvery mist.
    - He’s left **unconscious**, drained but alive — the vines retreat from the scimitar.
    - **Divine voice** (Selûne) whispers gently to the group: _"You chose mercy where others chose might."_
    
    ---
    
    ### 💠 Optional Consequences / Rewards
    
    - The party may earn **a Moonstone Favor** — a one-time blessing from Selûne (grants _Sanctuary_ or _Shield of Faith_ once/day).
    - Meran may become a future **NPC ally**, guiding them toward mysteries of the Weave.
    - **Brother Auryn’s agents** may view this as “proof of weakness” — increasing cult aggression.
- 🔪 Lunarcrescent
    
    ## 🌙 **Lunarcrescent**
    
    _Weapon (scimitar), uncommon (requires attunement by a good-aligned creature)_
    
    ---
    
    ### 🛠️ **Weapon Type**: Scimitar
    
    - **Damage**: 1d6 slashing
    - **Properties**: Finesse, light
    - **Magical Bonus**: +1 to attack and damage rolls
    
    ---
    
    ### ✨ **Lunar Blessings**
    
    - While under **moonlight** (outdoors at night or in magical moonlight), the blade sheds **dim light in a 10-foot radius**, and:
        - You score a **critical hit on a 19 or 20**.
        - You gain **advantage on saving throws against being charmed or frightened**.
    
    ---
    
    ### 🌕 **Moonflash (1/Long Rest)**
    
    As a bonus action, you may cause Lunarcrescent to **flare with divine light**.
    
    - Choose one creature within 30 ft.
    - It must succeed on a **DC 13 Constitution saving throw**, or be **blinded until the end of its next turn**.
    - Undead and shapechangers make this save at **disadvantage**.
- 🧬 **“**Redflame Fever**”** _(Venereal Affliction, Magical Disease)_
    
    > "Beware the smile of the silver-eyed courtesan, for Redflame burns long after the candle’s out." – Saying among dockhands in Baldur’s Gate
    
    ### 📜 Lore:
    
    "Redflame Fever" is a **magical-transmitted disease** (MTD) often spread through **intimate contact**, but it can also be passed by **sharing drinking vessels, blood rituals**, or **certain infernal pacts**. Scholars argue whether it originated from **infernal contracts**, **succubus venom**, or a **fey prank gone too far**.
    
    ---
    
    ## 🩸 **Stages & Debuffs**
    
    ### **Stage 1 – Embers of Infection** _(1d6 days after exposure)_
    
    - Symptoms: Fatigue, light fever, sensitive skin
    - **Debuff:** -1 to all Charisma checks (due to irritability and twitching)
    - May pass unnoticed, especially with alcohol or magic suppressants
    
    ### **Stage 2 – Redflame Rash** _(after 1d6 days in Stage 1)_
    
    - Symptoms: Fiery red splotches across the body, especially torso and groin
    - **Debuff:** Disadvantage on Persuasion and Stealth checks (itching, visible lesions)
    - Spells requiring **verbal components** have a 10% chance to **falter** from involuntary spasms
    
    ### **Stage 3 – Mindblister** _(after 2d6 weeks if untreated)_
    
    - Symptoms: Hallucinations, memory gaps, mood swings
    - **Debuff:** -1 to Intelligence and Wisdom checks & saves
    - Disadvantage on Concentration checks
    - Every long rest: roll **DC 12 Wisdom save** — on failure, become **confused (1d4 rounds)** when combat starts
    
    ---
    
    ## 💀 Left Untreated
    
    After 2 months, the disease becomes **chronic**, reducing max HP by **1d4 per week** and slowly degrading the mind. Magical healing like _Greater Restoration_, _Lesser Restoration_, or _Remove Curse_ (if infernal in origin) can cleanse it.
    
    ---
    
    ## 🧪 Cure Options
    
    - **Lesser Restoration:** Ends Stage 1 or 2
    - **Greater Restoration or Remove Curse:** Required for Stage 3+
    - **Alchemical Cure (Homebrew):** Brewable with:
        - Bloodroot extract
        - Ashcap mushrooms
        - Holy water (1 vial)
    
    ---
    
    ## 😈 Optional Add-ons
    
    - A specific **succubus/incubus variant** can **inflict** this intentionally.
    - The disease may carry a **mark or curse** visible only in moonlight.
    - Could be used by cults or crime lords as **bioweapon blackmail**.
- 👹 Nullborns
    
    ## ☠️ **Nullborn Overview**
    
    **Origin**: Formed when creatures are **unwritten**, **merged**, or **erased** by the Silencer’s creeping infection in the Weave.
    
    **Aesthetic**: Black-veined, semi-translucent skin. Faces that flicker between expressions. Bits of armor, spell glyphs, or body parts that “twitch in and out” of existence.
    
    ---
    
    ## ⚔️ Nullborn Examples by Level
    
    ---
    
    ### 🧟 **Nullborn Echostitch** _(Level 3 Encounter)_
    
    **CR**: 1 or 2
    
    **Appearance**: A lurching goblin-sized creature made from **halfling limbs**, a **catlike tail**, and **arcane tattoos** that burn faintly across its body.
    
    **Traits**:
    
    - **Unstable Spells**: Can cast a glitched _Magic Missile_ that hits a random target in range (even itself).
    - **Whispering Void**: Each turn, emits a psychic pulse. All creatures in 10 ft must succeed on a **DC 12 Wisdom save** or have disadvantage on their next spell/attack.
    - **Erratic Movements**: When hit, rolls 1d6. On 5–6, it **blinks 10 ft** in a random direction.
    
    ---
    
    ### 👹 **Nullborn Curselayer** _(Level 5 Encounter)_
    
    **CR**: 5
    
    **Appearance**: A half-melted tiefling form merged with elven bones, three shadowy arms, and draconic scales along one side. Its mouth emits _reversed incantations_.
    
    **Traits**:
    
    - **Nullblade**: Its weapon is part shadow, part spell — deals **1d8 slashing + 2d6 force**.
    - **Anti-Magic Pulse (1/short rest)**: All magic effects within 10 ft are suppressed for 1 round.
    - **Multiattack**: Two blade strikes, and once per round it can force a **Concentration check** on a target even without dealing damage.
    - **Flicker Dodge**: As a reaction, teleport 5 ft and gain +2 AC until end of turn.
    
    ---
    
    ### 🧬 **Nullborn Obliterator** _(Level 10 Encounter / Boss Minion)_
    
    **CR**: 8–10
    
    **Appearance**: Towering amalgamation of three warriors — part bugbear, part aasimar, part drow. Their limbs overlap and reshape constantly. Magic scrolls and holy symbols are embedded in their chest like wounds.
    
    **Traits**:
    
    - **Reality Fracture Aura** (30 ft): Enemies have **disadvantage on Arcana and Religion checks**, and **spell saves are at –2**.
    - **Shatter Identity** (Recharge 5–6): Choose a PC. That player randomly **forgets a feature** (racial, class, feat, or spell) for 1 minute (DM decides or roll randomly).
    - **Multiattack**: 2 nullfist strikes (2d10 force each) + _Twist of Magic_ — copies a PC’s last cast spell (1/day).
    - **Phaseout (Legendary Action)**: Becomes incorporeal until the start of its next turn, taking half damage from non-force attacks.
    
    ---
    
    ## 🌀 Nullborn Behavior:
    
    - Often repeat fractured lines like: _“I… was… something…”_ or _“No name… left…”_
    - Can be **tracked by areas where spells fail, light flickers, or names vanish from memory**.

- ⏳ **Faction : The Hourglass Veil**
    
    ### 🕯 Who They Are:
    
    A secretive and fractured **cult of fate manipulators**, historians, and heretics who believe **time is not a fixed line** but a resource to be exploited. They seek to **reshape history** by unlocking forgotten divine relics — especially those tied to **Chronos**.
    
    ### 🕯 Ideology:
    
    - The gods once ruled time, but mortals must now **steal it back**.
    - **Truth is irrelevant** — only the **power to write new truths** matters.
    - Amaunator's relics are seen as **keys to the cosmic clockwork**, and they will twist his faith for their gain.
    
    ### 🕯 Symbols:
    
    - An **hourglass with shattered glass** or inverted sand.
    - Their agents wear **reversible sun symbols**, showing either Amaunator's light or an hourglass depending on orientation.
    
    ### 🕯 Methods:
    
    - Infiltrate religious orders, libraries, and villages tied to divine knowledge.
    - Kidnap scholars and mages to extract or decode ancient secrets.
    - Use **memory alteration**, **illusion magic**, and forged divine relics to control perception.
- 🛡️ **Faction** : **Dawnmere Town Watch – "The Dayguard"**
    
    **Motto**: _“Light Above, Order Below”_
    
    - A local peacekeeping force created by town charter nearly 80 years ago.
    - Primarily focused on **keeping order**, settling **civil disputes**, **patrolling marketplaces**, and **escorting clerics or dignitaries**.
    - Occasionally aid with **monster threats**, but mostly rely on adventurers or mercenaries for high-risk engagements.

    ### 👨‍✈️ Chief of the Guard: **Captain Halmer Vaelstone**
    
    - **Race**: Human
    - **Age**: 52
    - **Background**: Former soldier, once served in the standing army of Elturel before settling in Dawnmere.
    - **Appearance**: Broad-shouldered and thick-bearded, with close-cropped silver hair and a sunburst-shaped scar on his left forearm.
    - **Personality**: Stern but deeply fair. Believes in “doing things by the book,” but secretly worried about how law, magic, and the gods are blurring lately.
    - **Alignment**: Lawful Neutral
    - **Equipment**: Chainmail, longsword, reinforced shield with Dawnmere’s crest. Keeps a silver locket with his late wife's portrait tucked in his armor.
    - **Traits**:
        - **Battle-Tested Commander**: Grants advantage on initiative rolls to allies within 10 ft in the first round of combat once per long rest.
        - **Keen Eye**: Passive Perception 15. Halmer misses very little.
- 🕵️‍♂️ **Hood of Whispered Intent**
    
    - **Wondrous Item, uncommon (requires attunement by Rogue)**
    - **Appearance**: A charcoal-gray hood lined with threads of silver that glimmer when you're standing behind someone.
    - **Effect**:
        - While in **Stealth** and **within 5 feet behind a creature**, you can **glimpse into their pockets** as if you had cast _Detect Magic_ and _X-Ray Vision_ on a very small area.
        - Once per short rest, you may make a **DC 13 Investigation check** to identify **one object** the target is carrying _without alerting them_.
        - This ability **does not work on magically concealed or extradimensional items**, like Bag of Holding contents.
    - **Bonus Fluff**: The hood occasionally whispers vague phrases like “coin... left pouch…” or “key… too heavy…”. These whispers are only audible to the wearer.
- 🧣 **Moonveil Wrap**
    
    - **Wondrous Item, uncommon**
    - **Effect**:
        - Material resistant to most forms of magic
        - Suppresses the magic of any fully wrapped item inside
        - Makes these items magic undetectable
        - After each use, roll a d6. On a **1**, the wrap frays and loses its magic.
    - **Fluff**: Threads shimmer under moonlight and vanish in sunlight.
- 💡Inspiration
    
    - Used Bag of Almost holding or radiant chest offensively
    - Found the gambler to be cheating, or somehow won against him
    - Realized Auryn was a fraud
    - Opened the chest successfully to grab the relic
    - Killed the Lunarshroud under the basement
- Blacksmith
    
- Tavern
    
- Town Guard
    
- End of adventure / Final dream:
    
    Everone in the party is marked as a Path-chosen

        We have tall houses, but anything trying to get out of the village I would see

        - Lenric, a reclusive who was the last person to visit Gilda, a small house in the northern part of the city.
        
        Time of the murder was in the late evening and that she was stabbed in her back. We were instructed not to let any of the suspects go on the crime scene.

            - Jars of herbs and bones. Spices. Lots of salt.
            - Crystal ball vision: Gilda coming and talking with Moira and her being scared.

                Was in love, agreed with it. Always thought she was gifted, but didn’t like ow she used her gifts.
                
                Is kinda nervous around magic.
                
                One evening, about a couple weeks ago was having a night walk because I couldn’t sleep for some reason. It was a very silent night? and I heard someone grunting, couldn’t guess the direction, but it was like a man wearing something heavy.
                
                Knows about cursed temple.

            ## 🕯️ **Crime Scene: Gilda’s Cottage**
            
            ### 📍 **Scene Setup (for DM to narrate)**
            
            > The cottage rests at the edge of Hearthglen, half-covered by overgrown lilac bushes. A narrow dirt path leads to the door, where a circle of white salt has been carefully poured, unbroken. Small bones—mostly animal, but one disturbingly human finger bone—dot the salt ring like placed stones on a game board.
            > 
            > Inside, the air smells faintly of lilac and ink. Her **writing desk is overturned**, parchment scattered. A cracked **moonstone charm** lies clenched in her lifeless hand, and a broken quill lies near the hearth. On the wall, half-scrawled in what might be ink—or blood—is the sentence:
            > 
            > _“He has no past, only shapes.”_
